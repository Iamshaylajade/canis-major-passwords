# canis-major-passwords
Mod 3 Challenge

## Description
This application is a random password generator.
Wanting to create an application that makes passwords.
With so much technology it's important to have a strong password. With so many different logins and requirments to update passwords often
it's easy to get burnt out with new passwords. 
This application will create a password for you based on a few options that you choose. Its completely random.
I appreciate getting to use the skills we've talked about in class. Its easy to watch but when you create you understand
and remember so much more.
